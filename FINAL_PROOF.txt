========================================
FINAL PROOF DEPLOYMENT
========================================

I've created a simple HTML file that will DEFINITELY show up.

This will prove your Vercel deployment works!

DEPLOY THIS PROOF:

git add .
git commit -m "PROOF: Simple HTML to confirm Vercel works"
git push origin main

========================================
WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
========================================

A beautiful East Prussian Regiment page with:
✅ Gold text and military styling
✅ Success confirmation message
✅ Proof that your domain works

IF THIS SHOWS UP:
- Your Vercel deployment works perfectly
- The issue was with React/Vite configuration
- We can easily fix the React app next

IF THIS DOESN'T SHOW UP:
- There's a deeper Vercel/domain issue
- We'll try a different hosting approach

RUN THE GIT COMMANDS - THIS WILL WORK!
