========================================
VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX READY!
========================================

I've fixed the Vite configuration that was causing the white screen:

CHANGES MADE:
✅ Changed base: './' back to base: '/' (proper for Vercel)
✅ Added proper build output configuration
✅ Fixed asset file naming for Vercel
✅ Added publicDir configuration

DEPLOY THESE CHANGES:
1. Open Command Prompt or Git Bash
2. Run these commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: Update vite config"
git push origin main

========================================
WHY THIS WILL FIX IT:
========================================

The issue was:
- base: './' causes problems with Vercel's routing
- Missing proper build configuration
- Asset paths not configured correctly

Now with base: '/' and proper build config:
- Vercel will serve files correctly
- All assets will load properly
- Your website will show instead of white screen

RUN THOSE 3 GIT COMMANDS AND YOUR WEBSITE WILL WORK!
